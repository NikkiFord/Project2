# Project2 - Pack It Now

In this project, a user can log in with FaceBook and create lists of packing items for an upcoming trip. It also uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the projected weather for the next 5 days in the city they are going, and suggest items to them based on the weather. It will also suggest some "essential" items. They can add items to their list, and check them off as they pack. Because it remembers them as a user in the database, they can log out, then return later to their same list.
